# MicrophoneMouseClick
An assistive software that allows clicking by blowing on the microphone.

There is settings.txt file. Inside there is a number. This corresponds to the threshold for clicking. Range: 0~100. Warning: a low value will result to accidental clicking.
Keep blowing to drag, short blow to left click, double blow to double click.
Future work: implement right click.
